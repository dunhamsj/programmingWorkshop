    "# Version Control with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "[Git-scm](https://git-scm.com/) (aka git) is a very poweful tool for version control. Git is referred to as the \"stupid content tracker\" because it is so simple and lightweight. It gets its name from a British slang term for a stupid person, a git; and scm stands for source code management. It is very useful if you are developing a large code and want to play around with different ideas without hurting the working version (aka the master branch) of the code. It is ideal for multiple people working on the same code, but I don't use it like that. I only use it for myself, which makes things a little easier. Every time you make a significant change you \"commit\" it and Git will track it. So, if you make a change but later on find out that you want to do something different you can easily revert to a version of the code as it was before you made the change. Or, if you want to play around with a new idea you can create a new \"branch\" which you can do whatever you want to and it won't affect the master branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "I barely scratch the surface of git's potential and still find it incredibly useful. [Here](https://git-scm.com/videos \"Git tutorial\") are four short videos that explain Git (especially the third video, Get Going with Git), and [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/ \"List of Git commands\") is a list of Git commands with links to their own pages. Let's assume that you already have Git installed (if not, click [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)), and create our first git project."
