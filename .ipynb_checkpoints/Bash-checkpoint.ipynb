    "# Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is a very common [shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#What-is-a-shell_003f) for Unix systems, i.e. OSX and Linux machines. Find the main documentation [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html). When you open a terminal on a Mac you are opening a Bash shell (and when you type `python` and press enter you turn this into a Python shell). I think of Bash as a programming language. It has built-in commands, such as `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and many others (find a nice list [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse390a/14au/bash.html)). In addition, it also has the ability to store variables, do basic math, execute for loops, and much more! We'll start the same way almost every programming tutorial I've ever sen starts, with \"Hello, World!\"."

    "[sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html) (Stream EDitor) is a powerful tool for replacing strings with other strings in files. Say for example you have a $10^{23}$ line code and throughout your code you have a variable called `chicken`. But for some reason you find out that you have to capitalize it to `CHICKEN`. This would be tedious to do by hand. Luckily, you don't have to! The syntax is this:\n",

If you leave this blank, i.e. `''`, then no backup file will be created. Obviously you have to be careful when using that. `s` means \"substitute\" and the `g` means \"global\" (i.e. replace it everywhere).\n",
