Next, `cd` into it and create a file called 'FirstGitFile.txt' and put some text in it. Once that is done, type `git status`. It should say something like there are untracked files. This is because the folder on your machine is different from the one on your Github account. To add your new file to Github, you need three commands (note they are in alphabetical order, and this is the order you will usually enter them):\n",

Once this is done you can go to your account and you should see that the last commit was just a few seconds ago. I'm not sure what the `-u` does, but I always include it. `origin` refers to the remote location (i.e., GitHub), and `main` refers to the branch at that remote location. Again type `git status` and check that everything is up to date."
